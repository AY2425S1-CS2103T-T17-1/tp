## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command
   to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   <img src="images/Ui.png" alt="Ui" style="width: 90%;">

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    - `list`: Lists all contacts.
    - `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 u/NUS m/Computer Science b/13-12-2003`:
      Adds a contact named **John Doe** to the address book.

      <box type="info" seamless>
      
      **Note**: The `add` command supports **optional fields** such as:
        - `w/WORK_EXPERIENCE`: Specifies past work or internships (e.g., `w/Intern,Google,2023`).
        - `i/INTEREST`: Adds interests to a contact (e.g., `i/Photography`).
        - `t/TAG`: Tags to label the contact (e.g., `t/friends`).
      
      </box>

      These fields can be added to make contact information more detailed. Here’s an example with optional fields included:
      ```markdown
       add n/Alice Tan p/91234567 e/alice@example.com a/Blk 123 Clementi Ave 3, #05-10 u/NTU m/Engineering b/15-04-2000 w/Intern,Google,2023 i/Photography t/friend
      ```

    - `addi in/1 i/Reading`:
      Adds an interest called **Reading** to the contact at index 1.
    - `findu u/NUS`: Finds all contacts studying at **NUS**.
    - `findi i/Swimming`: Finds all contacts whose interests include **Swimming**.
    - `exit`: Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Note that name cannot include prefixes that are already part of our commands.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- Work experience parameter `[w/WORK_EXPERIENCE]` can only be used one time. <br>

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Format:

```plaintext
find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]
```

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Type `list` to view the full list of contacts again.
</box>

- The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
- The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
- Only the name is searched.
- Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
- Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:

- `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
- `find bob lee` returns `Bob Chen`, `Catherine Lee`<br>
  <img src="images/findBobLeeResult.png" alt="result for 'find bob lee'" style="width: 80%;">

<br>

#### Finding Contacts by Interest: `findi`

Finds contacts with specific interests.

Format:

```plaintext
findi i/INTEREST
```

- `i/INTEREST`: Interest to search for. **Partial matches** are allowed, meaning any contact with an interest that partially matches the provided keyword will be listed.

Example: Finds contacts with the interest "swimming."
- **Exact Match**: 
```plaintext
findi i/swimming
```
- **Partial Match**: 
```plaintext
findi i/swim
```
<img src="images/findPplSwimming.png" alt="result for 'find i/swimming'" style="width: 80%;">

Invalid Input: **searching by multiple interests** is not supported and will trigger an error message:
```plaintext
Invalid command format! 
findi: Finds all persons whose interests contain the specified keyword (case-insensitive) and displays them as a list with index numbers.
Parameters: i/KEYWORD
```
Invalid formats:
```plaintext
findi i/reading i/swimming
```
```plaintext
findi i/reading,i/swimming
```
```plaintext
findi i/reading, i/swimming
```
```plaintext
findi i/reading swimming
```
```plaintext
findi i/reading,swimming
```
```plaintext
findi i/reading, swimming
```


<br>

Example: Find contacts associated with SUTD.
- **Exact Match**:
```plaintext
findu u/SUTD
```
- **Partial Match**:
```plaintext
findu u/SUT
```

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note**:
The `findu` command operates based on the **current list of contacts displayed**. To ensure you search from the full contact list, type `list` before using `findu`. This refreshes the view to show all contacts, allowing `findu` to accurately filter contacts from the complete data set.

</box>

**Example Workflow**:
1. Type `list` to display all contacts.
2. Use `findu u/NUS` to filter and show only contacts from NUS.

<br>

#### Finding Contacts by Major: `findm`

Finds contacts with a specific major from the currently displayed list.

Example: Finds contacts with the major "Computer Science"
- **Exact Match**:
```plaintext
findm m/Computer Science
```
- **Partial Match**:
```plaintext
findm m/Comp

- The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:

- `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
- `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

<br>

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

```plaintext
clear
```
<br>

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

```plaintext
exit
```

<br>

## Data Management

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

---

## Known issues


1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Major and University Field Validation**:
    - The application currently allows numbers-only input for the **major** and **university** fields (e.g., `m/12345` or `u/9876`), which is unintended.
    - **Limitation**: The app does not restrict users from entering numerical values or potential module codes as majors and universities.
    - **Planned Solution**: We plan to introduce stricter input validation to prevent numbers-only entries for these fields in future versions.
4. **When adding a new user**, the birthday field is compulsory.
5. **After deleting fields in json data file**, upon running the Universe app, the address book returned is empty but without an error message.
